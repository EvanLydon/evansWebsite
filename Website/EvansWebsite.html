<pre>Hi Kota,
   My name is Evan. I'm a 22 year old software development graduate from galway with a passion for computers and technology in general. I am currently working in the retail industry in galway as a sales assitant in Dunnes stores and although I love the day to day interaction with customers I feel I could be putting my skills as a software developer to better use with a company like shopify.
   To join your team would be a massive step for me and a challenge that i would absolutely love to undertake. To become apart of such a fast growing company would be a dream come true for me. I would love to begin my hopefully long lasting IT career with shopify and further increase my knowledge and experience with web design and development.
   Although I have not studied much web development in college, I have developed a massive interest in it and using my software development skills and knowledge learned how to develop websites using HTML5 and CSS3 while also learning how to use the Jquery library.
   In my spare time i love playing video games, going outside and working out. I have always had a love for video games ever since the first time I watched my Dad playing games on his desktop when i was a small child, from games like Doom and Diablo to simple games like minesweeper and solitare. Ever since those days I have loved playing every single type of video game from horror games to racing games and shooters. Although I do spend a lot of my spare time playing video games, I do still love going outside and being fit as well. I try and go to the gym 5 days a week and keep myself as fit as i possibly can. I also try and get outside as much as possible even though that can be limited by the weather that we have here in galway. Myself and my girlfriend love taking her dog for walks and sitting outside with a coffee whilst people watching.
   Other hobbies of mine include reading books and creating websites. Although I do not create actual used websites, I still enjoy the process of creating one and styling it in different ways. It gives me a great sense of achievement when i create something that is aesthetically pleasing and has nice features on it.
   I hope that this paragraph about myself could give you an insight into the type of individual that I am and hopefully shows that I am a good fit for shopify
